Matrix A is symmetric. Therefore A = At. Therefore BtA = BtAt = (BA)t and BtAB is also symmetric. Additionally, BtAB is a diagonal matrix, where only the diagonal line is equipped. All other values are 0. The values are listed with a exponent of about e-16, which is lower than machine accuracy and therefore 0.
